This repository contains code for the Spring 2023 intermediate project for the AISA at the University of Oregon. 

## Setup

The first thing you will need is an OpenAI API key. We will provide you a key. If you want to use your own API key, go to the [OpenAI Developer Console](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create a new secret key.
Create a .env file through whatever method your prefer; ```touch .env``` and so on. Then edit that file and write
```OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."```
where sk... is your api key you created.
